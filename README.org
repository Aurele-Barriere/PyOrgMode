* PyOrgMode
PyOrgMode is a small python library able to do simple tasks with your org files. It allows you to generate org files or treat them in an automated fashion. 

This project is not my top priority, but I'm more than happy to receive pull requests. Don't worry, even if it takes some time, I go through all of them ;)

I'd like to thank all the people that contributes (see AUTHORS file).
